<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document describes how the W3C WEBRTC RTCPeerConnection interface<a href="#W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617">[W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617]</a> is used to control the setup, management and teardown of a multimedia session.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#sec.general-design-of-jsep" id="sec.general-design-of-jsep">General Design of JSEP</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The thinking behind WebRTC call setup has been to fully specify and control the media plane, but to leave the signaling plane up to the application as much as possible. The rationale is that different applications may prefer to use different protocols, such as the existing SIP or Jingle call signaling protocols, or something custom to the particular application, perhaps for a novel use case. In this approach, the key information that needs to be exchanged is the multimedia session description, which specifies the necessary transport and media configuration information necessary to establish the media plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">With these considerations in mind, this document describes the Javascript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP) that allows for full control of the signaling state machine from Javascript.  JSEP removes the browser almost entirely from the core signaling flow, which is instead handled by the Javascript making use of two interfaces: (1) passing in local and remote session descriptions and (2) interacting with the ICE state machine.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it always occurs between two browsers. Note though in many cases it will actually be between a browser and some kind of server, such as a gateway or MCU. This distinction is invisible to the browser; it just follows the instructions it is given via the API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed, the initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer() API. The application optionally modifies that offer, and then uses it to set up its local config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is then sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling mechanism (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the remote party installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">When the call is accepted, the callee uses the createAnswer() API to generate an appropriate answer, applies it using setLocalDescription(), and sends the answer back to the initiator over the signaling channel. When the offerer gets that answer, it installs it using setRemoteDescription(), and initial setup is complete. This process can be repeated for additional offer/answer exchanges.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Regarding ICE <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, JSEP decouples the ICE state machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE state machine must remain in the browser, because only the browser has the necessary knowledge of candidates and other transport info.  Performing this separation also provides additional flexibility; in protocols that decouple session descriptions from transport, such as Jingle, the session description can be sent immediately and the transport information can be sent when available. In protocols that don't, such as SIP, the information can be used in the aggregated form. Sending transport information separately can allow for faster ICE and DTLS startup, since ICE checks can start as soon as any transport information is available rather than waiting for all of it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does require the application to be aware of the signaling process. While the application does not need to understand the contents of session descriptions to set up a call, the application must call the right APIs at the right times, convert the session descriptions and ICE information into the defined messages of its chosen signaling protocol, and perform the reverse conversion on the messages it receives from the other side.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.8">One way to mitigate this is to provide a Javascript library that hides this complexity from the developer; said library would implement a given signaling protocol along with its state machine and serialization code, presenting a higher level call-oriented interface to the application developer. For example, libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP or XMPP.  Thus, JSEP provides greater control for the experienced developer without forcing any additional complexity on the novice developer.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> <a href="#sec.other-approaches-consider" id="sec.other-approaches-consider">Other Approaches Considered</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to include a lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing session descriptions to the API, the API would produce and consume messages from this protocol. While providing a more high-level API, this put more control of signaling within the browser, forcing the browser to have to understand and handle concepts like signaling glare. In addition, it prevented the application from driving the state machine to a desired state, as is needed in the page reload case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to decouple the management of the media control objects from session descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control each component directly. This was rejected based on a feeling that requiring exposure of this level of complexity to the application programmer would not be beneficial; it would result in an API where even a simple example would require a significant amount of code to orchestrate all the needed interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that needed to be agreed upon and documented. In addition, these API points could be called in any order, resulting in a more complex set of interactions with the media subsystem than the JSEP approach, which specifies how session descriptions are to be evaluated and applied.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the basic session description-oriented API, but to move the mechanism for generating offers and answers out of the browser. Instead of providing createOffer/createAnswer methods within the browser, this approach would instead expose a getCapabilities API which would provide the application with the information it needed in order to generate its own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work that the application needs to do; it needs to know how to generate session descriptions from capabilities, and especially how to generate the correct answer from an arbitrary offer and the supported capabilities.  While this could certainly be addressed by using a library like the one mentioned above, it basically forces the use of said library even for a simple example. Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this problem, but still allows applications to generate their own offers/answers (to a large extent) if they choose, using the description generated by createOffer as an indication of the browser's capabilities.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state machine, other than the generic need to exchange SDP media descriptions in the fashion described by <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a> (offer/answer) in order for both sides of the session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP provides mechanisms to create offers and answers, as well as to apply them to a session.  However, the browser is totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by which these offers and answers are communicated to the remote side, including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare handling.  These issues are left entirely up to the application; the application has complete control over which offers and answers get handed to the browser, and when.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#sec.session-descriptions-and-" id="sec.session-descriptions-and-">Session Descriptions and State Machine</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">In order to establish the media plane, the user agent needs specific parameters to indicate what to transmit to the remote side, as well as how to handle the media that is received. These parameters are determined by the exchange of session descriptions in offers and answers, and there are certain details to this process that must be handled in the JSEP APIs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Whether a session description applies to the local side or the remote side affects the meaning of that description. For example, the list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates what the local side is willing to receive, which, when intersected with the set of codecs the remote side supports, specifies what the remote side should send.  However, not all parameters follow this rule; for example, the SRTP parameters <a href="#RFC4568">[RFC4568]</a> sent to a remote party indicate what the local side will use to encrypt, and thereby what the remote party should expect to receive; the remote party will have to accept these parameters, with no option to choose a different value. [[OPEN ISSUE: This is not correct because we removed SDES (https://github.com/rtcweb-wg/jsep/issues/10)]] </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the format of offers versus answers. For example, a offer may propose multiple SRTP configurations, but an answer may only contain a single SRTP configuration. [[OPEN ISSUE: See issue 10 above.]]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Lastly, while the exact media parameters are only known only after an offer and an answer have been exchanged, it is possible for the offerer to receive media after they have sent an offer and before they have received an answer. To properly process incoming media in this case, the offerer's media handler must be aware of the details of the offer before the answer arrives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly, the user agent needs: </p>

<ol>
  <li>To know if a session description pertains to the local or remote side.</li>
  <li>To know if a session description is an offer or an answer.</li>
  <li>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the answer.</li>
</ol>

<p> JSEP addresses this by adding both setLocalDescription and setRemoteDescription methods and having session description objects contain a type field indicating the type of session description being supplied. This satisfies the requirements listed above for both the offerer, who first calls setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), as well as for the answerer, who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.6">JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional by the application. Provisional answers provide a way for an answerer to communicate initial session parameters back to the offerer, in order to allow the session to begin, while allowing a final answer to be specified later. This concept of a final answer is important to the offer/answer model; when such an answer is received, any extra resources allocated by the caller can be released, now that the exact session configuration is known. These "resources" can include things like extra ICE components, TURN candidates, or video decoders.  Provisional answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation results; as a result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers can be received and applied during call setup.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.7">In <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>, the constraint at the signaling level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given session, but at the media stack level, a new offer can be generated at any point. For example, when using SIP for signaling, if one offer is sent, then cancelled using a SIP CANCEL, another offer can be generated even though no answer was received for the first offer. To support this, the JSEP media layer can provide an offer via the createOffer() method whenever the Javascript application needs one for the signaling.  The answerer can send back zero or more provisional answers, and finally end the offer-answer exchange by sending a final answer. The state machine for this is as follows:</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#sec.session-description-forma" id="sec.session-description-forma">Session Description Format</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">In the WebRTC specification, session descriptions are formatted as SDP messages. While this format is not optimal for manipulation from Javascript, it is widely accepted, and frequently updated with new features. Any alternate encoding of session descriptions would have to keep pace with the changes to SDP, at least until the time that this new encoding eclipsed SDP in popularity. As a result, JSEP currently uses SDP as the internal representation for its session descriptions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">However, to simplify Javascript processing, and provide for future flexibility, the SDP syntax is encapsulated within a SessionDescription object, which can be constructed from SDP, and be serialized out to SDP. If future specifications agree on a JSON format for session descriptions, we could easily enable this object to generate and consume that JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Other methods may be added to SessionDescription in the future to simplify handling of SessionDescriptions from Javascript. In the meantime, Javascript libraries can be used to perform these manipulations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.4">Note that most applications should be able to treat the SessionDescriptions produced and consumed by these various API calls as opaque blobs; that is, the application will not need to read or change them. The W3C WebRTC API specification will provide appropriate APIs to allow the application to control various session parameters, which will provide the necessary information to the browser about what sort of SessionDescription to produce.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#sec.ice" id="sec.ice">ICE</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">When a new ICE candidate is available, the ICE Agent will notify the application via a callback; these candidates will automatically be added to the local session description. When all candidates have been gathered, the callback will also be invoked to signal that the gathering process is complete.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.4.1">3.4.1.</a> <a href="#sec.ice-candidate-trickling" id="sec.ice-candidate-trickling">ICE Candidate Trickling</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.p.1">Candidate trickling is a technique through which a caller may incrementally provide candidates to the callee after the initial offer has been dispatched; the semantics of "Trickle ICE" are defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]</a>. This process allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately, without having to wait for the caller to gather all possible candidates.  This results in faster media setup in cases where gathering is not performed prior to initiating the call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.p.2">JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing APIs that provide control and feedback on the ICE candidate gathering process.  Applications that support candidate trickling can send the initial offer immediately and send individual candidates when they get the notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support this feature can simply wait for the indication that gathering is complete, and then create and send their offer, with all the candidates, at this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.p.3">Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving application will supply them to its ICE Agent. This triggers the ICE Agent to start using the new remote candidates for connectivity checks.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.1.p.1">As with session descriptions, the syntax of the IceCandidate object provides some abstraction, but can be easily converted to and from the SDP candidate lines.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.1.p.2">The candidate lines are the only SDP information that is contained within IceCandidate, as they represent the only information needed that is not present in the initial offer (i.e., for trickle candidates). This information is carried with the same syntax as the "candidate-attribute" field defined for ICE. For example:</p>
<pre>
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.1.p.3">The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate which m= line it should be associated with. The m line can be identified in one of two ways; either by a m-line index, or a MID. The m-line index is a zero-based index, with index N referring to the N+1th m-line in the SDP sent by the entity which sent the IceCandidate.  The MID uses the "media stream identification", as defined in <a href="#RFC5888">[RFC5888]</a>, to identify the m-line. WebRTC implementations creating an ICE Candidate object MUST populate both of these fields. Implementations receiving an ICE Candidate object SHOULD use the MID if they implement that functionality, or the m-line index, if not.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.1">JSEP applications typically inform the browser to begin ICE gathering via the information supplied to setLocalDescription, as this is where the app specifies the number of media streams for which to gather candidates. However, to accelerate cases where the application knows the number of media streams to use ahead of time, it MAY ask the browser to gather a pool of potential ICE candidates to help ensure rapid media setup. When setLocalDescription is eventually called, and the browser goes to gather the needed ICE candidates, it SHOULD start by checking if any candidates are available in the pool.  If there are candidates in the pool, they SHOULD be handed to the application immediately via the ICE candidate callback.  If the pool becomes depleted, either because a larger-than-expected number of media streams is used, or because the pool has not had enough time to gather candidates, the remaining candidates are gathered as usual.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking where an SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For example, SIP <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> defines both a "Parallel Search" and "Sequential Search". Although these are primarily signaling level issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have some impact on the configuration of the media plane that is relevant. When forking happens at the signaling layer, the Javascript application responsible for the signaling needs to make the decisions about what media should be sent or received at any point of time, as well as which remote endpoint it should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the media engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the application. The basic operations that the applications can have the media engine do are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Start exchanging media to a given remote peer, but keep all the resources reserved in the offer.</li>
  <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free any resources in the offer that are not being used.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.5.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5.1">3.5.1.</a> <a href="#sec.sequential-forking" id="sec.sequential-forking">Sequential Forking</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.1">Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, but only one active session ever exists at a time; no mixing of received media is performed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.2">JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the application to easily control the policy for selecting the desired remote endpoint.  When an answer arrives from one of the callees, the application can choose to apply it either as a provisional answer, leaving open the possibility of using a different answer in the future, or apply it as a final answer, ending the setup flow.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.3">In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be applied as a final answer, and the application will reject any subsequent answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK + BYE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.4">In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be applied as provisional answers, and any previous call leg will be terminated.  At some point, the application will end the setup process, perhaps with a timer; at this point, the application could reapply the existing remote description as a final answer.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5.2">3.5.2.</a> <a href="#sec.parallel-forking" id="sec.parallel-forking">Parallel Forking</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.1">Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, and multiple simultaneous active signaling sessions can be established as a result. If multiple callees send media at the same time, the possibilities for handling this are described in Section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>. Most SIP devices today only support exchanging media with a single device at a time, and do not try to mix multiple early media audio sources, as that could result in a confusing situation. For example, consider having a European ringback tone mixed together with the North American ringback tone - the resulting sound would not be like either tone, and would confuse the user. If the signaling application wishes to only exchange media with one of the remote endpoints at a time, then from a media engine point of view, this is exactly like the sequential forking case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.2">In the parallel forking case where the Javascript application wishes to simultaneously exchange media with multiple peers, the flow is slightly more complex, but the Javascript application can follow the strategy that <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a> describes using UPDATE. The UPDATE approach allows the signaling to set up a separate media flow for each peer that it wishes to exchange media with. In JSEP, this offer used in the UPDATE would be formed by simply creating a new PeerConnection and making sure that the same local media streams have been added into this new PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would produce a SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to perform the UPDATE strategy discussed in <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.3">As a result of sharing the media streams, the application will end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each with a local and remote description and their own local and remote addresses. The media flow from these sessions can be managed by specifying SDP direction attributes in the descriptions, or the application can choose to play out the media from all sessions mixed together. Of course, if the application wants to only keep a single session, it can simply terminate the sessions that it no longer needs.</p>

If the application does not indicate a candidate pool size, the browser may select any default candidate pool size.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">In addition, the application can specify its preferred policy regarding use of BUNDLE, the multiplexing mechanism defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>.  By specifying a policy from the list below, the application can control how aggressively it will try to BUNDLE media streams together.  The set of available policies is as follows: </p>

  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The application will BUNDLE all media streams of the same type together. That is, if there are multiple audio and multiple video MediaStreamTracks attached to a PeerConnection, all but the first audio and video tracks will be marked as bundle-only, and candidates will only be gathered for N media streams, where N is the number of distinct media types. When talking to a non-BUNDLE-aware endpoint, only the non-bundle-only streams will be negotiated. This policy balances desire to multiplex with the need to ensure basic audio and video still works in legacy cases. Data channels will be in a separate bundle group.  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"/>
  <dt>max-bundle:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The application will BUNDLE all of its media streams, including data channels, on a single transport. All streams other than the first will be marked as bundle-only.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.4">In the event createOffer is called after the session is established, createOffer will generate an offer to modify the current session based on any changes that have been made to the session, e.g. adding or removing MediaStreams, or requesting an ICE restart. For each existing stream, the generation of each SDP line must follow the process defined for generating an updated offer from the RFC that specifies the given SDP line. For each new stream, the generation of the SDP must follow the process of generating an initial offer, as mentioned above. If no changes have been made, or for SDP lines that are unaffected by the requested changes, the offer will only contain the parameters negotiated by the last offer-answer exchange. The exact handling of subsequent offer generation is detailed in <a href="#sec.subsequent-offers">Section 5.2.2</a>. below.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.1">Session description objects (RTCSessionDescription) may be of type "offer", "pranswer", and "answer". These types provide information as to how the description parameter should be parsed, and how the media state should be changed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.2">"offer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an offer; said description may include many possible media configurations. A description used as an "offer" may be applied anytime the PeerConnection is in a stable state, or as an update to a previously supplied but unanswered "offer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.3">"pranswer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an answer, but not a final answer, and so should not result in the freeing of allocated resources. It may result in the start of media transmission, if the answer does not specify an inactive media direction. A description used as a "pranswer" may be applied as a response to an "offer", or an update to a previously sent "pranswer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.4">"answer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an answer, the offer-answer exchange should be considered complete, and any resources (decoders, candidates) that are no longer needed can be released. A description used as an "answer" may be applied as a response to a "offer", or an update to a previously sent "pranswer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.5">The only difference between a provisional and final answer is that the final answer results in the freeing of any unused resources that were allocated as a result of the offer. As such, the application can use some discretion on whether an answer should be applied as provisional or final, and can change the type of the session description as needed. For example, in a serial forking scenario, an application may receive multiple "final" answers, one from each remote endpoint. The application could choose to accept the initial answers as provisional answers, and only apply an answer as final when it receives one that meets its criteria (e.g. a live user instead of voicemail).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.p.6">"rollback" is a special session description type implying that the state machine should be rolled back to the previous state, as described in <a href="#sec.rollback">Section 4.1.4.2</a>.  The contents MUST be empty.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.4.1">4.1.4.1.</a> <a href="#sec.use-of-provisional-answer" id="sec.use-of-provisional-answer">Use of Provisional Answers</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1.p.1">Most web applications will not need to create answers using the "pranswer" type. While it is good practice to send an immediate response to an "offer", in order to warm up the session transport and prevent media clipping, the preferred handling for a web application would be to create and send an "inactive" final answer immediately after receiving the offer. Later, when the called user actually accepts the call, the application can create a new "sendrecv" offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start the media flow. While this could also be done with an inactive "pranswer", followed by a sendrecv "answer", the initial "pranswer" leaves the offer-answer exchange open, which means that neither side can send an updated offer during this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1.p.2">As an example, consider a typical web application that will set up a data channel, an audio channel, and a video channel. When an endpoint receives an offer with these channels, it could send an answer accepting the data channel for two-way data, and accepting the audio and video tracks as inactive or receive-only. It could then ask the user to accept the call, acquire the local media streams, and send a new offer to the remote side moving the audio and video to be two-way media. By the time the human has accepted the call and triggered the new offer, it is likely that the ICE and DTLS handshaking for all the channels will already have finished.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1.p.3">Of course, some applications may not be able to perform this double offer-answer exchange, particularly ones that are attempting to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In these cases, "pranswer" can still provide the application with a mechanism to warm up the transport.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.4.2">4.1.4.2.</a> <a href="#sec.rollback" id="sec.rollback">Rollback</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.1">In certain situations it may be desirable to "undo" a change made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription. Consider a case where a call is ongoing, and one side wants to change some of the session parameters; that side generates an updated offer and then calls setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either before or after setRemoteDescription, decides it does not want to accept the new parameters, and sends a reject message back to the offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly the answerer as well, need to return to a stable state and the previous local/remote description. To support this, we introduce the concept of "rollback".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.2">A rollback discards any proposed changes to the session, returning the state machine to the stable state, and setting the modified local and/or remote description back to their previous values. Any resources or candidates that were allocated by the abandoned local description are discarded; any media that is received will be processed according to the previous local and remote descriptions. Rollback can only be used to cancel proposed changes; there is no support for rolling back from a stable state to a previous stable state. Note that this implies that once the answerer has performed setLocalDescription with his answer, this cannot be rolled back.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.3">A rollback is performed by supplying a session description of type "rollback" with empty contents to either setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription, depending on which was most recently used (i.e. if the new offer was supplied to setLocalDescription, the rollback should be done using setLocalDescription as well).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.1">The setLocalDescription method instructs the PeerConnection to apply the supplied SDP blob as its local configuration. The type field indicates whether the blob should be processed as an offer, provisional answer, or final answer; offers and answers are checked differently, using the various rules that exist for each SDP line.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.2">This API changes the local media state; among other things, it sets up local resources for receiving and decoding media. In order to successfully handle scenarios where the application wants to offer to change from one media format to a different, incompatible format, the PeerConnection must be able to simultaneously support use of both the old and new local descriptions (e.g. support codecs that exist in both descriptions) until a final answer is received, at which point the PeerConnection can fully adopt the new local description, or roll back to the old description if the remote side denied the change.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.3">This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering process.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.1">When createOffer is called for the first time, the result is known as the initial offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.2">The first step in generating an initial offer is to generate session-level attributes, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5. Specifically: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The first SDP line MUST be "v=0", as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.1</li>
  <li>The second SDP line MUST be an "o=" line, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.2. The value of the &lt;username&gt; field SHOULD be "-". The value of the &lt;sess-id&gt; field SHOULD be a cryptographically random number. To ensure uniqueness, this number SHOULD be at least 64 bits long. The value of the &lt;sess-version&gt; field SHOULD be zero. The value of the &lt;nettype&gt; &lt;addrtype&gt; &lt;unicast-address&gt; tuple SHOULD be set to a non-meaningful address, such as IN IP4 0.0.0.0, to prevent leaking the local address in this field. As mentioned in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, the entire o= line needs to be unique, but selecting a random number for &lt;sess-id&gt; is sufficient to accomplish this.</li>
  <li>The third SDP line MUST be a "s=" line, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.3; to match the "o=" line, a single dash SHOULD be used as the session name, e.g. "s=-".  Note that this differs from the advice in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a> which proposes a single space, but as both "o=" and "s=" are meaningless, having the same meaningless value seems clearer.  </li>
  <li>Session Information ("i="), URI ("u="), Email Address ("e="), Phone Number ("p="), Bandwidth ("b="), Repeat Times ("r="), and Time Zones ("z=") lines are not useful in this context and SHOULD NOT be included.</li>
  <li>Encryption Keys ("k=") lines do not provide sufficient security and MUST NOT be included.</li>
  <li>A "t=" line MUST be added, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.9; both &lt;start-time&gt; and &lt;stop-time&gt; SHOULD be set to zero, e.g. "t=0 0".</li>
  <li>An "a=msid-semantic:WMS" line MUST be added, as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-msid">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-msid]</a>, Section 4.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.3">The next step is to generate m= sections, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a> Section 5.14, for each MediaStreamTrack that has been added to the PeerConnection via the addStream method. (Note that this method takes a MediaStream, which can contain multiple MediaStreamTracks, and therefore multiple m= sections can be generated even if addStream is only called once.) m=sections MUST be sorted first by the order in which the MediaStreams were added to the PeerConnection, and then by the alphabetical ordering of the media type for the MediaStreamTrack.  For example, if a MediaStream containing both an audio and a video MediaStreamTrack is added to a PeerConnection, the resultant m=audio section will precede the m=video section. If a second MediaStream containing an audio MediaStreamTrack was added, it would follow the m=video section.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.4">Each m= section, provided it is not being bundled into another m= section, MUST generate a unique set of ICE credentials and gather its own unique set of ICE candidates. Otherwise, it MUST use the same ICE credentials and candidates as the m= section into which it is being bundled. Note that this means that for offers, any m= sections which are not bundle-only MUST have unique ICE credentials and candidates, since it is possible that the answerer will accept them without bundling them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.5">For DTLS, all m= sections MUST use the certificate for the identity that has been specified for the PeerConnection; as a result, they MUST all have the same <a href="#RFC4572">[RFC4572]</a> fingerprint value, or this value MUST be a session-level attribute.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.6">Each m= section should be generated as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.14. For the m= line itself, the following rules MUST be followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The port value is set to the port of the default ICE candidate for this m= section; if this m= section is not being bundled into another m= section, the port value MUST be unique. If no candidates have yet been gathered, and a 'null' port value is being used, as indicated in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice]</a>, Section 5.1., this port MUST still be unique.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.11">The application can also modify the SDP to reduce the capabilities in the offer it sends to the far side or the offer that it installs from the far side in any way the application sees fit, as long as it is a valid SDP offer and specifies a subset of what was in the original offer.  This is safe because the answer is not permitted to expand capabilities and therefore will just respond to what is actually in the offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.12">As always, the application is solely responsible for what it sends to the other party, and all incoming SDP will be processed by the browser to the extent of its capabilities.

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The IETF has published separate documents <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch]</a> <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]</a> describing the security architecture for WebRTC as a whole.  The remainder of this section describes security considerations for this document.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">While formally the JSEP interface is an API, it is better to think of it is an Internet protocol, with the JS being untrustworthy from the perspective of the browser. Thus, the threat model of <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a> applies.  In particular, JS can call the API in any order and with any inputs, including malicious ones. This is particularly relevant when we consider the SDP which is passed to setLocalDescription(). While correct API usage requires that the application pass in SDP which was derived from createOffer() or createAnswer() (perhaps suitably modified as described in <a href="#sec.configurable-sdp-paramete">Section 6</a>, there is no guarantee that applications do so. The browser MUST be prepared for the JS to pass in bogus data instead.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Conversely, the application programmer MUST recognize that the JS does not have complete control of browser behavior. One case that bears particular mention is that editing ICE candidates out of the SDP or suppressing trickled candidates does not have the expected behavior: implementations will still perform checks from those candidates even if they are not sent to the other side.  Thus, for instance, it is not possible to prevent the remote peer from learning your public IP address by removing server reflexive candidates. Applications which wish to conceal their public IP address should instead configure the ICE agent to use only relay candidates.  </p>
